<h1>JAVA Functions</h1>
<p>
A Java method is a collection of statements that are grouped together to perform an operation. When you call the System.out.println() method, for example, the system actually executes several statements in order to display a message on the console.

Now you will learn how to create your own methods with or without return values, invoke a method with or without parameters, and apply method abstraction in the program design.
<h2>Creating Method</h2>
Considering the following example to explain the syntax of a method −
<h3>Syntax</h3>

<pre>
&nbsppublic static int methodName(int a, int b) {
&nbsp   // body
&nbsp}
</pre></div>
Here,
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>public static</b> − modifier</p></li>
<li><p><b>int</b> − return type</p></li>
<li><p><b>methodName</b> − name of the method</p></li>
<li><p><b>a, b</b> − formal parameters</p></li>
<li><p><b>int a, int b</b> − list of parameters</p></li>
</ul>
Method definition consists of a method header and a method body. The same is shown in the following syntax −
<h3>Syntax</h3>

<pre>
&nbspmodifier returnType nameOfMethod (Parameter List) {
   &nbsp// method body
&nbsp}
</pre></div>
The syntax shown above includes −
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>modifier</b> − It defines the access type of the method and it is optional to use.</p></li>
<li><p><b>returnType</b> − Method may return a value.</p></li>
<li><p><b>nameOfMethod</b> − This is the method name. The method signature consists of the method name and the parameter list.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Parameter List</b> − The list of parameters, it is the type, order, and number of parameters of a method. These are optional, method may contain zero parameters.</p></li>
<li><p><b>method body</b> − The method body defines what the method does with the statements.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
Here is the source code of the above defined method called min(). This method takes two parameters num1 and num2 and returns the maximum between the two −

<pre>
&nbsp/** the snippet returns the minimum between two numbers */

&nbsppublic static int minFunction(int n1, int n2) {
   &nbspint min;
   &nbspif (n1 > n2)
      &nbspmin = n2;
   &nbspelse
      &nbspmin = n1;

   &nbspreturn min; 
&nbsp}
</pre></div>
<h2>Method Calling</h2>
For using a method, it should be called. There are two ways in which a method is called i.e., method returns a value or returning nothing (no return value).

The process of method calling is simple. When a program invokes a method, the program control gets transferred to the called method. This called method then returns control to the caller in two conditions, when −
<ul class="list">
<li>the return statement is executed.</li>
<li>it reaches the method ending closing brace.</li>
</ul>
The methods returning void is considered as call to a statement. Lets consider an example −

<pre>
&nbspSystem.out.println("This is tutorialspoint.com!");
</pre></div>
The method returning value can be understood by the following example −

<pre>
&nbspint result = sum(6, 9);
</pre></div>
Following is the example to demonstrate how to define a method and how to call it −
<h3>Example</h3>

<pre>
&nbsppublic class ExampleMinNumber {
   
   &nbsppublic static void main(String[] args) {
      &nbspint a = 11;
      &nbspint b = 6;
      &nbspint c = minFunction(a, b);
      &nbspSystem.out.println("Minimum Value = " + c);
   &nbsp}

   &nbsp/** returns the minimum of two numbers */
   &nbsppublic static int minFunction(int n1, int n2) {
      &nbspint min;
      &nbspif (n1 > n2)
         &nbspmin = n2;
     &nbsp else
&nbsp         min = n1;

      &nbspreturn min; 
   &nbsp}
&nbsp}

&nbsp<b>Output :-</b>

&nbspMinimum value = 6
</pre></div>
<h3>The void Keyword</h3>
The void keyword allows us to create methods which do not return a value. Here, in the following example we're considering a void method methodRankPoints. This method is a void method, which does not return any value. Call to a void method must be a statement i.e. methodRankPoints(255.7);. It is a Java statement which ends with a semicolon as shown in the following example.
<h3>Example</h3>

<pre>
&nbsppublic class ExampleVoid {

&nbsp   public static void main(String[] args) {
     &nbsp methodRankPoints(255.7);
   &nbsp}

   &nbsppublic static void methodRankPoints(double points) {
      &nbspif (points >= 202.5) {
         &nbspSystem.out.println("Rank:A1");
      &nbsp}else if (points >= 122.4) {
         &nbspSystem.out.println("Rank:A2");
      &nbsp}else {
         &nbspSystem.out.println("Rank:A3");
      &nbsp}
   &nbsp}
&nbsp}

&nbsp<b>Output :-</b>
&nbspRank:A1
</pre></div>
<h2>The Constructors</h2>
A constructor initializes an object when it is created. It has the same name as its class and is syntactically similar to a method. However, constructors have no explicit return type.

Typically, you will use a constructor to give initial values to the instance variables defined by the class, or to perform any other startup procedures required to create a fully formed object.

All classes have constructors, whether you define one or not, because Java automatically provides a default constructor that initializes all member variables to zero. However, once you define your own constructor, the default constructor is no longer used.
<h3>Example</h3>
Here is a simple example that uses a constructor without parameters −

<pre>
&nbsp// A simple constructor.
&nbspclass MyClass {
   &nbspint x;

   &nbsp// Following is the constructor
   &nbspMyClass() {
      &nbspx = 10;
   &nbsp}
&nbsp}
You will have to call constructor to initialize objects as follows −

&nbsppublic class ConsDemo {

   &nbsppublic static void main(String args[]) {
      &nbspMyClass t1 = new MyClass();
      &nbspMyClass t2 = new MyClass();
      &nbspSystem.out.println(t1.x + " " + t2.x);
   &nbsp}
&nbsp}

&nbsp<b>Output :-</b>
&nbsp10 10
</pre></div>
Parameterized Constructor
Most often, you will need a constructor that accepts one or more parameters. Parameters are added to a constructor in the same way that they are added to a method, just declare them inside the parentheses after the constructor's name.
<h3>Example</h3>
Here is a simple example that uses a constructor with a parameter −

<pre>
&nbsp// A simple constructor.
&nbspclass MyClass {
   &nbspint x;
   
   &nbsp// Following is the constructor
   &nbspMyClass(int i ) {
      &nbspx = i;
   &nbsp}
&nbsp}

&nbsppublic class ConsDemo {

   &nbsppublic static void main(String args[]) {
      &nbspMyClass t1 = new MyClass( 10 );
      &nbspMyClass t2 = new MyClass( 20 );
      &nbspSystem.out.println(t1.x + " " + t2.x);
   &nbsp}
&nbsp}
&nbspThis will produce the following result −

&nbsp<b>Output :-</b>

&nbsp10 20
</pre></div>
