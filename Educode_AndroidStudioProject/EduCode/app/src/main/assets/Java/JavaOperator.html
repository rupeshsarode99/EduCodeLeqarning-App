<h1>JAVA Operators</h1>
<p>
	Java provides a rich set of operators to manipulate variables. We can divide all the Java operators into the following groups −
	<ul class="list">
<li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
<li>Relational Operators</li>
<li>Bitwise Operators</li>
<li>Logical Operators</li>
<li>Assignment Operators</li>
<li>Misc Operators</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Arithmetic Operators</h2>
Arithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the same way that they are used in algebra. The following table lists the arithmetic operators 
<table border="1px">
<tbody><tr>
<th>Operator</th>
<th >Description</th>
<th >Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >+ (Addition)</td>
<td >Adds values on either side of the operator.</td>
<td >A + B will give 30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >- (Subtraction)</td>
<td>Subtracts right-hand operand from left-hand operand.</td>
<td >A - B will give -10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >* (Multiplication)</td>
<td>Multiplies values on either side of the operator.</td>
<td >A * B will give 200</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >/ (Division)</td>
<td>Divides left-hand operand by right-hand operand.</td>
<td >B / A will give 2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >% (Modulus)</td>
<td>Divides left-hand operand by right-hand operand and returns remainder.</td>
<td >B % A will give 0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >++ (Increment)</td>
<td>Increases the value of operand by 1.</td>
<td >B++ gives 21</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >-- (Decrement)</td>
<td>Decreases the value of operand by 1.</td>
<td >B-- gives 19</td>
</tr>

<h2>The Relational Operators</h2>
There are following relational operators supported by Java language.
<table border="1px">
<tbody><tr>
<th >Operator</th>
<th >Description</th>
<th >Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >== (equal to)</td>
<td>Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.</td>
<td >(A == B) is not true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >!= (not equal to)</td>
<td>Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.</td>
<td >(A != B) is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >&gt; (greater than)</td>
<td>Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.</td>
<td >(A &gt; B) is not true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >&lt; (less than)</td>
<td>Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.</td>
<td >(A &lt; B) is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >&gt;= (greater than or equal to)</td>
<td>Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.</td>
<td >(A &gt;= B) is not true.</td>

<h2>The Logical Operators</h2>
The following table lists the logical operators −
<table border="1px">
<tbody><tr>
<th >Operator</th>
<th >Description</th>
<th >Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >&amp;&amp; (logical and)</td>
<td>Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.</td>
<td >(A &amp;&amp; B) is false</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >|| (logical or)</td>
<td>Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.</td>
<td >(A || B) is true</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >! (logical not)</td>
<td>Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false.</td>
<td >!(A &amp;&amp; B) is true</td>
</tr>
