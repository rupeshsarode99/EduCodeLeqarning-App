<h1>Java Variable</h1>
<p>

A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in Java has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.
<br>
You must declare all variables before they can be used. Following is the basic form of a variable declaration −
<br>
data type variable [ = value][, variable [ = value] ...] ;
Here data type is one of Java's datatypes and variable is the name of the variable. To declare more than one variable of the specified type, you can use a comma-separated list.
<br>
Following are valid examples of variable declaration and initialization in Java −
<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
&nbspint a, b, c;         // Declares three ints, a, b, and c.<br>
&nbspint a = 10, b = 10;  // Example of initialization<br>
&nbspbyte B = 22;         // initializes a byte type variable B.<br>
&nbspdouble pi = 3.14159; // declares and assigns a value of PI.<br>
&nbspchar a = 'a';        // the char variable a iis initialized with value 'a'
</p>

This chapter will explain various variable types available in Java Language. There are three kinds of variables in Java −
<ul class="list">
<li>Local variables</li>
<li>Instance variables</li>
<li>Class/Static variables</li>
</ul>
<h2>Local Variables</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Local variables are declared in methods, constructors, or blocks.</p></li>
<li><p>Local variables are created when the method, constructor or block is entered and the variable will be destroyed once it exits the method, constructor, or block.</p></li>
<li><p>Access modifiers cannot be used for local variables.</p></li>
<li><p>Local variables are visible only within the declared method, constructor, or block.</p></li>
<li><p>Local variables are implemented at stack level internally.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no default value for local variables, so local variables should be declared and an initial value should be assigned before the first use.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
Here, age is a local variable. This is defined inside pupAge() method and its scope is limited to only this method.

<p>
&nbsppublic class Test {<br>
   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppublic void pupAge() {<br>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspint age = 0;<br>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspage = age + 7;<br>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSystem.out.println("Puppy age is : " + age);<br>
   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp}<br>

   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppublic static void main(String args[]) {<br>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTest test = new Test();<br>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptest.pupAge();<br>
   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp}<br>
&nbsp}<br>
&nbsp<b>Output:-</b>  <br>
&nbspPuppy age is: 7
</p>
</div>
<h3>Example</h3>
Following example uses age without initializing it, so it would give an error at the time of compilation.

<p>
&nbsppublic class Test {<br>
   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppublic void pupAge() {<br>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspint age;<br>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspage = age + 7;<br>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSystem.out.println("Puppy age is : " + age);<br>
   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp}<br>

   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppublic static void main(String args[]) {<br>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTest test = new Test();<br>
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptest.pupAge();<br>
   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp}<br>
&nbsp}<br>
&nbsp<b>Output:-</b>
<pre>
&nbspTest.java:4:variable number might not have been initialized
&nbspage = age + 7;
         ^
&nbsp1 error
</pre>
