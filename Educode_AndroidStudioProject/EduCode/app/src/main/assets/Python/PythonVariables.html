<h2>Creating Variables</h2>

<p>Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.</p>

<p>A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>


<h3>Example</h3>

<pre>
&nbspx = 5
&nbspy = "John"
&nbspprint(x)
&nbspprint(y)
</pre></div>

<p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre>
&nbspx = 4 # x is of type int
&nbspx = "Sally" # x is now of type str
&nbspprint(x)
</pre></div>
<hr>

<h2>Variable Names</h2>

A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for Python variables:

<ul>
<li>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character</li>
<li>A variable name cannot start with a number</li>
<li>A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )</li>
<li>Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)</li>
</ul>
