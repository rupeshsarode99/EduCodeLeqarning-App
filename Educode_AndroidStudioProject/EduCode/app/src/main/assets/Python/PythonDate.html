<h1>Python Date and Time</h1>
<p>
There are two different date and time objects in Python. These are:
<div class="card-body"><ul><li>naive</li><li>aware</li></ul></div>
The differences between 'naive' and 'aware' objects are: <ol><li>The 'aware' object holds the details about time-zone and daylight saving information whereas na√Øve objects do not have that feature.</li><li>Naive objects are easy to understand and to work with.</li></ol><h2>Defining Tick</h2>As we all can make an idea that time intervals have to be represented in floating point number. The floating-point numbers in units of seconds are signified by Tick in python. Particular instants of time are represented in seconds since 12:00 am, 1<sup>st</sup> of January, of the year 1990. A popular module name 'time' is available which provides functions that let's programmer work with time and made conversion between time-representation possible. The pre-defined function time.time() is used to return the current time of the system. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <br>The daytime module exports the constants listed below:</span> <ul><li>MINYEAR</li><li>MAXYEAR</li></ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Two programs are shown showing the use of two different modules:</span>

<h3>Example</h3>

	<pre>
	<br>&nbspimport time;
&nbspticktock = time.time();

&nbspprint("Number of ticks:", ticktock)
&nbspNumber of ticks: 1465927104.951356
</pre></div>
<h3>Another program showing datetime module:</h3>

	<pre>
	<br>&nbspfrom datetime import datetime

&nbsppresentime = datetime.now()

&nbspprint(" NOW THE TIME IS:", presentime)

&nbspprint("Todays Date is:", presentime.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') )

&nbspprint("Year is:", presentime.year)

&nbspprint("Month is:", presentime.month)

&nbspprint("Day is:", presentime.day)

&nbsp<b>Output :-</b>
&nbspNOW THE TIME IS: 2016-06-14 18:01:25.831269
&nbspTodays Date is: 2016-06-14
&nbspYear is: 2016
&nbspMOnth is: 6
&nbspDay is: 14
</pre></div>
<h2>Timetuple In Python</h2>
Python usually handles time's function as a tuple with nine numbers starting from zero (0) to eight (8).
<table border="1"><tbody><tr><td >0</td><td >Four digit number (year)</td><td >2016</td></tr><tr><td >1</td><td >Months</td><td >1 - 12</td></tr><tr><td >2</td><td >Day</td><td >1 - 31</td></tr><tr><td >3</td><td >Hour</td><td >0 - 23</td></tr><tr><td >4</td><td >Minute</td><td >0 - 59</td></tr><tr><td >5</td><td >Second</td><td >0 - 60</td></tr><tr><td >6</td><td >Days of the week</td><td >0 - 6 (where Zero designates Monday)</td></tr><tr><td >7</td><td >Days of a year</td><td >1 - 366</td></tr><tr><td >8</td><td >Daylight saving</td><td >-1, 0, 1, -1</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h2>Timedelta Object</h2>
It is used to represent duration, i.e.  the difference between two dates and or times.  For invoking this, the syntax is:

	<pre>
	&nbspdatetime.timedelta([days, [,seconds [,microseconds [,milliseconds [, minutes [,hours [,weeks]]]]]])
</pre></div>
	<h2>Program To Get Current Time</h2>

	<pre>
&nbspimport time;

&nbspcurtime = time.localtime(time.time())

&nbspprint("Current Time is:", curtime)

&nbsp<b>Output:- </b>
&nbspCurrent Time is: time.struct_time(tm_year=2016, tm_mon=6, tm_mday=14, tm_hour=0, tm_min=4, tm_sec=49, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=166, tm_isdst=0)
</pre></div>
<h2>Calendar Of A Month</h2>
<h3>Example</h3>

	<pre>
&nbspimport calendar

&nbspcalndr = calendar.month(2016, 6)

&nbspprint("The calendar for the month June of Year 2016 is:")

&nbspprint (calndr)
</pre></div>
